# Speer Technologies challenge

Create a simple social media application. DO NOT BUILD A USER INTERFACE, just a backend exposing a well-formed API. You can use anything you want for the server and storage layer. 

The API must adhere to REST standards. Focus on completing the basic functionality before moving on to the rest. The code you write is expected to be good quality, it should:

- Have correct formatting
- Have resilient error handling
- Exceptions should appropriate handling
- Architecture should be scalable, easy to maintain
- Tricky parts of the code should have proper documentation
- NOTE: Database queries should be efficient


## TASK 1:
### Section 1

- User registration using unique username and a password
- User login (Including session maintenance using any means you’re comfortable with)
- Unit tests for these basic methods


These two APIs should not have any errors. DO NOT move on to the remainder of the assignment until these are completed. If either of these APIs are missing or incomplete, the remainder of the assignment can not be marked properly and your submission will be invalid.



### Section 

Reminder: Please complete section 1 fully before attempting section 2. Complete the next tasks *in the order specified*

- Create, read, update, delete tweet (Twitter doesn’t support update, can you?)
- Unit/Integration tests for *all* endpoints you’ve built so far (Basic & Extended Functionality)


*THE FOLLOWING SECTION IS OPTIONAL*

### *Section 3

Start *only* once section 1 and 2 functionality is complete. The following endpoints are for bonus points, and you SHOULD NOT attempt them until all previous requirements are completed.

- Like/unlike a tweet
- Retweet
- Threading
